# LabAssignment1
This project is a simple website for an online food ordering system. It has basic functionalities like login,registration and viewing food orders.

# Getting started
First create a database by loading the iaplab.sql file.This will contain the users table which will be needed to populate the database with the information of the users when they register.
Using a web server,I used XAMPP, you can add the project to the htdocs in order for the project to be accessed using the localhost address.
Launch your web server and navigate to localhost/idnex.html to access the homepage.
